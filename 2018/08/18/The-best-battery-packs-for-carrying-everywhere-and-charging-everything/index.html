<p>Battery packs (also called power banks) are an essential purchase these days. Smartphone makers continue to prioritize shrinking down a device’s dimensions and thickness instead of extending the endurance and longevity we get out of our expensive handsets, but battery packs can augment the phone’s own power and offer some peace of mind.</p>
<p>Modern battery capacity ranges anywhere from 1,821mAh in the iPhone 8 to 4,000mAh in the new Galaxy Note 8. But even a big number doesn’t always guarantee your phone will comfortably last into a second day of texting, web browsing, swiping through Instagram, streaming Spotify, watching YouTube, and whatever else you do. Taken off the charger in the morning, most phones can make it through a typical day with some power to spare, but unfortunately you really can’t count on more than that. </p>
<p>By now <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/13/17675660/lithium-ion-battery-science-future-phone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our battery week coverage</a> has made clear that lithium ion batteries aren’t radically evolving or getting replaced anytime soon. So if you know you’re going to have a long day away from a power outlet, it’s time to put a battery pack in your bag. </p>
<p>Smartphones support a variety of charging speeds, standards, and ports depending on manufacturer and how recently they were released. If you’ve got an iPhone, it’s the Lightning jack. Newer Android phones should have a USB Type C port.</p>
<p>Some power banks <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPortable-Charger-Jackery-Bolt-6000%2Fdp%2FB01A6L85CC%2Fref%3Dsr_1_fkmr0_2%3Fie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1534457076%26sr%3D8-2-fkmr0%26keywords%3Dhackery%2Bbolt%2Busb-c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like the Jackery Bolt</a> have integrated charging cables for convenience, but I don’t like ‘em. If the integrated cord frays or breaks in some other way, it’s dead weight and useless. Plus, a lot of them still include a MicroUSB cable instead of USB-C, which might be handy for accessories like wireless headphones, but won’t do any good for your 2018 phone. So for the purpose of this roundup, I focused on good old battery packs with ports that’ll accept whatever cable you’ve already got. Finally, batteries are definitely one product category where you need to trust the brand you’re buying from. I’d avoid the bottom-dollar Amazon brands for this one; thankfully our picks are all relatively affordable.</p>
