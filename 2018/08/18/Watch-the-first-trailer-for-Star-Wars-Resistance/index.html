<p>Disney’s next animated <em>Star Wars</em> show just got its first trailer, and it’s looking like a light-hearted adventure about becoming a resistance pilot. As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/26/17285316/star-wars-resistance-animated-star-wars-show-disney-dave-filoni" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originally announced earlier this year</a>, <em>Resistance</em> is being helmed by <em>Clone Wars</em> and <em>Rebels</em> veteran Dave Filoni and stars Kazuda Xiono, a emotive newbie who seems a little over his head.</p>
<p>The show’s one-hour premiere — which will air on Disney Channel, DisneyNOW, and Disney Channel VOD, with subsequent airings on Disney XD, on October 7th — kicks off at the start of Xiono’s mission to spy on the First Order on a planet full of new aliens. Xiono — who bears an uncanny resemblance to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAXfI278tu0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bolin from <em>The Legend of Korra</em></a> — happens to live with a friend of Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac voices), so you should expect to see some familiar faces mixed in with totally new characters. The resourceful BB-8, for example, seems to be Xiono’s companion throughout his adventures, which are set before the events of <em>The Force Awakens.</em></p>
<p>Based on the trailer, it looks like <em>Resistance</em> will be defined in part by its distinctive cel-shaded animation style inspired by anime. Once Disney’s streaming service finally gets up and running — the estimate is now at late 2019 — <em>Resistance</em> will be joined by the live-action series from Jon Favreau that was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/9/16631218/disney-star-wars-live-action-television-show-streaming-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced last fall</a>, as well as the return of <em>The Clone Wars</em>, an additional 12-episode arc that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/19/17593108/star-wars-the-clone-wars-saved-disney-streaming-service-dave-filoni" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got a surprise reveal at San Diego Comic-Con in July</a>.</p>
